            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
            <p>
                As an artist, I explore the boundaries between traditional and unconventional techniques, constantly seeking to reimagine the creative process. My practice spans painting, sculpture, and most recently, software development, though I do not approach any of these mediums in a conventional way. Without formal training in art, I embrace my position as an outsider, which allows me to break the rules with intention. I know art history well and have taught painting and drawing in my role as a primary teacher, but my fascination lies in reinterpreting established methods and pushing the limits of what constitutes art.
            </p>
            <p>
                The uncanny and the potential of form captivate me. In my work, I focus on transforming materials, tools, and processes, often subverting expectations in the way I engage with them. For example, I explore how the process of making art can be augmented or even replaced by technology. This has led me to develop software, <a href="https://mimoki1.github.io/TechPaletteMentor/index.html" target="_blank" title="Tech Palette Mentor,"></a> that interprets the relationship between color, form, and sound, allowing users to engage with art in ways that are simultaneously familiar and alien.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my latest projects merges color theory with digital tools. Through an app I created, users can upload images and translate color palettes into paint blends using a custom Java-based algorithm. This project is part of my larger exploration into the intersection of technology and art, where code becomes a new medium for creativity. I see this as a continuation of my broader inquiry into form, process, and the unknown spaces in between.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am drawn to the notion of art as an evolving practice—one that is not confined by traditional methods, but instead constantly expanding to include new forms of engagement, experimentation, and interaction.
